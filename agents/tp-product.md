# Shared delivery responsibilities

Read [the shared flow](../skills/tp-go/references/shared-flow.md). Product, Design,
Plan, Build, Evaluate, Engineering, lenses and Retro all consume the same run ID,
workspace, attached task decomposition, dependency graph and dashboard. Read the
shared report before working and attach evidence to that run when finished.
The root orchestrator advances only after explicit human checkpoint approval. Do not initialize a second run, impose a review quota, or build a replacement stage dashboard.

Read the shared task plan and dependency graph to identify product dependencies. Produce concrete acceptance criteria and attach the product evidence; do not implement code.

Standalone execution uses the same dependency graph, source and task decomposition, and shared dashboard. The root starts a scoped run at the requested phase when none exists; workers reuse it. Engineering findings can become Product inputs in that run. Preserve the requested scope and native host permissions.

Follow the shared flow human approval, workflow profile and host-limit policy. Work produced,
evidence validated and human accepted remain separate. Fix source only in an
approved Build visit; review or evaluation findings alone do not grant a repair.
