# taskplane

[![CI](https://github.com/vdemkiv/taskPlane/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/vdemkiv/taskPlane/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

**Design, build, and review AI-generated software with evidence, not trust.** taskplane
is the AI software-delivery control plane for people who ship and review code
with Claude or Codex every day. You ask it to design, build, review, or show status;
behind that simple request it checks whether the work is ready, keeps every
agent inside an approved scope, and requires current implementation, test, and
review evidence before anything can be called done.

![taskplane 2.1 in action — a real safe-order-cancellation project: graph-aware Definition of Ready blocks an undeclared audit module → a human approves the corrected dependency-aware plan → the execution contract blocks a Codex edit outside scope → worker evidence cannot self-advance → an independent evaluator checks acceptance criteria, routed lenses, dependents, and the distributed contract → the full engineering review runs → final human sign-off](docs/assets/taskplane-cowork-flow.gif)

taskplane is not another prompt collection, review bot, or project tracker. It
is the governed execution and assurance layer between your intent and
agent-generated changes. Requirements, dependencies, contracts, implementation,
and review stay connected from Definition of Ready through Definition of Done.
A 26-lens engineering review makes architecture, solution design, security, data, operability,
UX, and other technical consequences explicit for engineers, EMs, PMs, and
nontechnical decision-makers.

**Simple for the user; strict for the agents.** State the goal, review the
evidence, and make only the decisions that require human judgment. taskplane
keeps the machinery — scoped contracts, dependency depth, independent
submissions, lifecycle gates, durable memory, and the live dashboard — behind
that interaction without weakening it.

## Four prompts are enough

> **taskplane design:** design safe order cancellation before we build it

> **taskplane build:** add CSV export to the monthly report

> **taskplane review:** review this branch against main; do not change code

> **taskplane status**

The `taskplane` skill routes those requests to the existing product, design,
build, engineering, status, and orchestration skills. You do not need to choose a
persona, remember loop commands, select review lenses, or set dependency
depth. taskplane reports a concise text summary after each material
transition and shows the richer dashboard when the host supports it.

This simplicity does **not** reduce agent work. A worker may only submit a
result; it cannot advance its own stage. The orchestrator independently runs
the engine gate, which recomputes source and review-artifact fingerprints and
rejects missing, stale, out-of-scope, under-tested, or under-reviewed work.
Human Design approval (when used), plan approval, and final sign-off remain
explicit.

## What taskplane does

- **The governed Evaluate-Loop.** Optional design → human Design approval → plan →
  human plan approval → build → evaluate → fix (≤2) → engineering review → human
  sign-off; serial or parallel waves, one enforced contract per agent, and only the
  orchestrator invokes the state-transition gate.
  [docs/loop-design.md](docs/loop-design.md), [docs/authority-matrix.md](docs/authority-matrix.md).
- **Enforced contracts.** Every agent runs inside a contract — file scope, action
  budget, denied commands, read-only for reviewers — screened by the PreToolUse
  hook before each tool call. Literal scope overrides carry provenance: only the
  human-approved plan's `plan_minted` mark authorizes them, never a CLI flag. [docs/state-spec.md](docs/state-spec.md).
- **26 lenses with intelligent routing v2.** The lens catalog (generated:
  [docs/lens-catalog.md](docs/lens-catalog.md)) is routed per stage profile (design
  8 · build 5 · review 26) by a signal engine that scores each lens against the
  actual diff and returns `deep` / `light` / `n/a` — every `n/a` carries
  machine-checkable negative evidence, the cap-8 budget demotes (never drops),
  security floors hold on enforcement diffs, and engine failure fails open to the
  full catalog. [docs/routing-and-flows.md](docs/routing-and-flows.md).
- **Graph decomposition.** `tp graph scan --decompose` derives a component layer
  inside the dependency graph (directory convention + import cohesion + AST
  clustering; floors overridable via `components.yaml`) with fingerprint-cached
  per-component lens maps. Reviews route the capped union of touched components'
  maps, `component_attribution` names which component proposed each routed lens, and
  the fail-open ladder only ever widens (component → module → full catalog). Same doc.
- **Governed flows.** The review wave and the execute/evaluate/fix waves each
  dispatch as one journaled, resumable Dynamic Workflow on Claude; the Task-dispatch
  path stays mandatory and byte-identical everywhere — it is the only Codex path —
  and every human gate stays reachable with workflows off (`TASKPLANE_WORKFLOWS`).
  On Codex, every brief carries a collision-safe native `task_name`, exact taskplane
  role marker and instructions, model tier, optional model, and tier-derived
  reasoning effort; execute waves register those identities before spawn so strict
  dispatch can reject a renamed, mis-routed, or partial handoff. Same doc.
- **The regression gate.** Each change is verified for actual regressions within its
  dependency-graph blast radius at the DoD gate: Tier 1 blocks a was-green-now-red
  test against the change's baseline; Tier 2 flags a changed enforcement/public
  entry point with no covering test. [docs/regression-gate-design.md](docs/regression-gate-design.md).
- **Audit cadence + router audits.** Every Nth review (`TASKPLANE_AUDIT_EVERY`) a
  full-catalog sweep diffs its findings against the routing; any finding from an
  `n/a`-routed lens is auto-filed as a router regression that blocks sign-off.
- **A knowledge base that compounds.** Requirements (refinement-scored, with
  dependencies and named contracts), decision records (ADRs with lifecycle and
  supersede chains), and tracked debt (`tp req debt`) persist in a plan-aware
  per-project store and are recalled by relevance at every step.
  [docs/requirements-core.md](docs/requirements-core.md), [docs/lenses-and-knowledge.md](docs/lenses-and-knowledge.md).
- **Dependency-graph DoR/DoD.** Requirements declare dependencies and the
  API/event/data/runtime contracts they provide, consume, or change; before plan
  approval the refreshed graph checks depth, boundaries, and every new module, and
  the DoD compares planned vs realized modules and rejects a stale graph fingerprint.

The moving parts: an enforcement kernel (contracts + lifecycle hook +
orchestrator-only gates + audit trace), the loop engine, the Design Contract phase,
26 read-only lens agents fanned out in parallel, the requirements/decisions/debt
knowledge base, a deterministic dependency graph with a zero-token blast-radius map,
and portable `cheap`/`standard`/`deep` model tiers routed per step, task, and lens —
mapped to models by env config, verifiable with `tp loop verify-dispatch`.

## What's new

The three most recent releases. [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) is the
authoritative, complete history — if the two ever disagree, the CHANGELOG wins.

| Version | Highlights |
| --- | --- |
| **v2.7.4** | **Windows encoding portability, gateable on the fast runner.** taskplane crashed on its own output on Windows: `open()` without an explicit encoding and printed arrows use the host's default codec, which is cp1252 there and UTF-8 on Linux, so the defect was invisible in normal CI and only surfaced on an advisory Windows leg that times out and cannot block. A C locale gives Python an ASCII default — narrower than cp1252 — so the class now reproduces and GATES on ubuntu in about two minutes: 314 failures before, 0 after. 587 call sites gained an explicit encoding, and the CLI and scripts reconfigure stdout to UTF-8. Path separators, CRLF goldens and `.git` teardown on Windows remain open and advisory. 1,541 tests. |
| **v2.7.3** | **The `qa` untested trigger was inert on the routing path reviews actually use.** v2.7.0 let `qa` fire on a change that ships no tests, but the trigger was verified only through the legacy stage-less router, where it appends reason text after applicability is already decided; on the stage-aware path it changed no verdict at all — the same shape as v2.6.0's inert fingerprint guardrail, and found by an independent Codex review rather than by this repo's tests. Absence is now applicability evidence inside the signal engine, with the stage profile still governing. Test detection also matched substrings, so `contest.py`, `latest.py` and `specification.py` counted as tests; it moves to a dependency-free `path_roles.py` that both routers import, matching path segments and filename patterns instead. Eleven regression tests. The Claude plugin package also gains a scripted, deterministic, CI-gated build; it had been assembled by hand every release. 1,541 tests. |
| **v2.7.1** | **Codex CI patch.** Moves `runner.temp`-derived Codex and taskplane state paths from job-level environment evaluation to the native-host pytest step, where GitHub exposes the runner context. This fixes the workflow-definition failure that prevented every CI job from starting in v2.7.0; runtime behavior is unchanged. 1,530 tests. |

## Install

How you install taskplane depends on your **account type**, and the paths are
genuinely different — the most common one (an org member on a Team/Enterprise
plan) is also the most restricted. Start with the row that matches you. Install
facts are current per the Claude docs as of August 2026:
[Use plugins in Claude](https://support.claude.com/en/articles/13837440-use-plugins-in-claude)
and [Plugin marketplaces](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/plugin-marketplaces).

### I'm on a Team or Enterprise account (not an org admin)

Honest first: **you cannot add taskplane from GitHub yourself.** On
Team/Enterprise accounts, plugins come from your organization's plugin catalog
(Customize → Plugins), which your org's owners curate; the personal
add-a-marketplace path is not available to you, and on Enterprise your admin may
restrict the catalog further (in Claude Code, managed settings can likewise block
marketplace adds — see [managed marketplace restrictions](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/plugin-marketplaces#managed-marketplace-restrictions)).

Your two real paths:

1. **Ask an org admin to publish taskplane** to your organization's marketplace —
   send them the [exact admin steps](#im-an-org-admin-teamenterprise) below. Once
   published, taskplane appears in your org plugin catalog and you install it from
   there in one click.
2. **File upload, where your org allows it:** download this repository as a ZIP
   from GitHub (**Code → Download ZIP**), then in Claude (Customize → Plugins)
   upload it as a custom plugin file. If no upload option is shown, your org has
   disabled personal plugin uploads — path 1 is the way.

Fallback: taskplane also works on a **personal Pro or Max account** with the
direct GitHub path below, if you want to evaluate it before asking your admin.

### I'm an org admin (Team/Enterprise)

Publish taskplane to your organization's marketplace from **Organization
settings → Plugins** (admin guide: [Manage plugins for your organization](https://support.claude.com/en/articles/13837433-manage-plugins-for-your-organization)):

- **Upload a file:** Add plugins → *Upload a file* → name the marketplace → drag
  in the plugin file (under 50 MB) → Upload. Re-uploading under the same name
  overwrites the previous version.
- **GitHub sync:** organization sync only reads **private or internal**
  repositories (through the Claude GitHub App), so mirror `vdemkiv/taskPlane`
  into a private repository in your org first, then connect it in `owner/repo`
  form. The initial sync runs automatically; toggle *Sync automatically* to pick
  up merged version bumps, or use *Update* for manual syncs.

Then set availability per plugin: **Installed by default**, **Available for
install** (listed in the catalog), **Required** (installed for everyone, not
removable), or **Not available**. Changes reach members on their next session or
plugin refresh. For org-managed Claude Code machines, allowlist the marketplace
via `strictKnownMarketplaces` / `extraKnownMarketplaces` in managed settings so
members' installs resolve without a blocked marketplace add
([settings reference](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/settings)).

### Personal, Pro, or Max account

The direct GitHub marketplace path works as-is. **Claude Desktop or claude.ai
(Chat / Cowork):** Customize → Plugins → **+** in *Personal plugins* →
**Add marketplace** → **"Add from a repository"** → paste
`https://github.com/vdemkiv/taskPlane` → *taskplane* appears → **Install**.

**Claude Code (terminal)** — same thing; the first command adds this repo as the source:

```
/plugin marketplace add vdemkiv/taskPlane
/plugin install taskplane@taskplane-marketplace
/reload-plugins
```

### Codex (OpenAI)

**Codex CLI:** add the GitHub marketplace, install taskplane, and open the plugin
browser to verify it is enabled:

```bash
codex plugin marketplace add vdemkiv/taskPlane
codex plugin add taskplane
codex
# inside Codex: /plugins
```

**Codex in the ChatGPT desktop app:** select **Codex**, open **Plugins**, choose
the `taskplane-marketplace` source after adding it, and install **taskplane**.
Open the repository as a local environment and start a new task.

Codex loads newly installed skills and hooks only in a new task/session, and asks
you to review and trust the bundled lifecycle hooks (`/plugins` confirms taskplane
is enabled). Keep Codex's own sandbox and approval controls enabled — taskplane's
scope contract is an additional guardrail, not a replacement. Plugins are supported
in Codex CLI and the Codex desktop app, not the IDE extension; until the public
listing is approved, install from this GitHub marketplace source. See
[Codex plugins](https://developers.openai.com/codex/plugins).

Requires `git` in your workspace (the gates need a commit snapshot) and Python 3
(standard library only; `python3` on macOS/Linux or the `py` launcher on
Windows). Nothing else to set up.

## Quickstarts

Command-first, one per host. Each ends the same way: say **"set up taskplane"**
and onboarding takes it from there.

### Quickstart: Claude Code (terminal)

```
# personal accounts (org members: install from your org's plugin catalog instead)
/plugin marketplace add vdemkiv/taskPlane
/plugin install taskplane@taskplane-marketplace
/reload-plugins
```

Open your project repository (it needs a git commit), then say **"set up taskplane"**.

### Quickstart: Cowork / Claude Desktop

1. Install taskplane by your account path above — org plugin catalog on
   Team/Enterprise, *Personal plugins → Add marketplace* on personal accounts.
2. Connect the folder / repository you want governed (Cowork: attach the folder).
3. Say **"set up taskplane"**.

### Quickstart: Codex

```bash
codex plugin marketplace add vdemkiv/taskPlane
codex plugin add taskplane
codex   # start a NEW task; approve the bundled hooks when prompted
```

`cd` to your project repository first (desktop: open it as a local environment),
then in the new task say **"set up taskplane"**.

## Onboarding — the short version

Say **"set up taskplane"**, or just state a goal — `taskplane` routes it and runs
onboarding for you on a fresh folder. `tp onboard` won't hand you to a governed run
until three checks are green: a real project folder to work in (an empty scratch
dir or the session root is refused), a git commit to diff against (the gates fail
closed without a snapshot), and `tp init` — which scaffolds the four context docs,
scans the dependency graph, and creates the knowledge base. On a brownfield
project, fill `current-state.md` first: it grounds every design review in as-built
reality, and reinventing an existing component is a blocker-class finding.
Onboarding then asks one question — keep taskplane knowledge private/local
(`personal`, `~/.taskplane`) or shared in-repo (`team`/`enterprise`,
`.taskplane-kb/`) — and reports the resolved model-tier map. Full detail — Codex
onboarding, sharing modes (`tp share`), model tiers and cost routing, and context
storage: [docs/onboarding.md](docs/onboarding.md).

## Honest about what the guardrails are

The scope/command guardrails are a real, mechanical help for the everyday failure —
an agent that drifts out of its lane or fires a destructive command by mistake. For
matched mutating tool routes the host exposes to plugin hooks, the PreToolUse screen
checks scope, denied commands, and the action budget **before** the call, resolves
`..`/absolute/symlink paths, treats destructive programs (`rm`, `chmod`, …) as
writes, and fails **closed** on a corrupt contract or screening error. Codex
subagent lifecycle hooks are deliberately advisory; optional
`TASKPLANE_ENFORCE_DISPATCH=strict` additionally fails closed unless a native spawn
matches an emitted task name, role marker, model, and reasoning effort. This is
keep-the-agent-on-topic, not a security sandbox: plugin hooks do not intercept tool
routes the host does not expose, arbitrary effects performed inside an allowed
process, or remote side effects. A task that grants `Bash` grants arbitrary code
execution, and no string-screen can fully contain a *determined adversary* — for a
hard boundary, keep Codex/Claude approvals and sandboxing enabled and add OS-level
isolation where needed (the token/$ budget is cooperative in the same way).
Likewise, "a worker cannot advance its own stage" is a
**protocol + audit** guarantee, not process isolation. What holds mechanically is
the **evidence**: a gate only advances on a submission whose fingerprints (changed
source plus the exact evaluator/engineering evidence bytes) still match the
workspace, so even a worker invoking the gate itself cannot pass unproven, stale,
or post-submission-edited work.
